Buggy 1:
Constructor/Method: isEmpty() 
Problem: Size is not being actively updated

Buggy 2:
Constructor/Method: Deck()
Problem: Size is not set in the constructor as the length of the array.

Buggy 3:
Constructor/Method: shuffle()
Problem: efficient selection shuffle is not shuffling the cards correctly.

Buggy 4: 
Constructor/Method: deal() / isEmpty()
Problem: Since the size is not being actively update (size is set as 0),
isEmpty() returns true and deal() returns null.

Buggy 5:
Constructor/Method: shuffle() / Deck()
Problem: Since the size isn't set correctly in the constructor, size is 0. 
Thus, the loop in shuffle starts at cards.size() - 1, or 0 - 1, which is -1, an
invalid index.
